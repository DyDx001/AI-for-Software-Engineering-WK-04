The provided Python script uses traditional selenium to test a login page. This script is "brittle"—if a developer changes an element's ID (e.g., from username to user_name_field), the test will break, requiring manual maintenance.
​AI-powered tools like Testim.io fundamentally solve this. They don't just record selectors; they use AI to understand the context of an element (e.g., "it's the text box labeled 'Username'"). If the ID changes, the AI is smart enough to find the element again using other attributes, making the test "self-healing."
​This massively improves test coverage and reduces maintenance overhead. Furthermore, AI tools can crawl an application to auto-discover new user paths and suggest test cases, identifying edge cases a manual tester might miss and ensuring new features are automatically covered.
